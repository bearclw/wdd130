   <h2>Patrick Bruce</h2>
   <p>I am working on a degree in Health Science Occupational Health and Safety. 
    I don't have many hobbies. My time is spent working for the local fire department and at the local community college helping paramedic students learn skills
    I live in Kansas City, Kansas. I have lived on the same property for 34 of my 41 years. 
    I served a mission is Roseville California in 2002. It was really sad when I heard Paradise, CA burned in the "campfire" of 2018.
    My wife and I have been married 14 years and I have 3 girls and 1 boy. 
    I am getting a degree to support my current career in the hopes of a future promotion.
    The thing I enjoy the most about BYUI is that we are all here for the same reason, to get a good education and show kindness to others.
    I am taking this course because it is completely different than anything else I have tried. I have no knowledge of web design and I am hoping to learn more about it.
    I am thinking about building a website but not sure what about yet.
    I have been a member of the church my entire life. My parents were converts when my oldest sibling was 10, I was born 14 years later.
    My favorite quote is from Thomas S. Monson, "The past is behind, learn from it. The future is ahead, prepare for it. The present is here, live it."
